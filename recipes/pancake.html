    <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>

        <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
        <li>Bananas</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) in one bowl and your wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed bananas) in another bowl.
